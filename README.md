**Alpha quality** you probably only want to use this if you like to send pull requests
fixing things :)

## How it works

See [our site](http://moose-team.github.io/friends/) or the `gh-pages` branch.

## Logging in

You need a working git + github configuration

- have a publicly listed github email (e.g. shows up on your github account)
- if you dont wanna do that then do `git config --global user.username yourusername`

When you launch the app it should "just work" now if you have git setup correctly :)

If it doesnt work, do this to get debug information:

```
$ npm i github-current-user -g
$ DEBUG=* github-current-user
```

Note: DSA keys are not supported. You should switch to RSA anyway for security reasons.

If it can't verify you, try doing `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Your key should show up when you run `ssh-add -l`.

## Building

You'll need the newest io.js and npm (`>= 1.8.1`, `>= 2.8.3`)

* `npm install`
* `npm run rebuild-leveldb` to compile leveldown for electron. you will have to modify the command in package.json if you are non a non 64 bit architecture
* `npm start` to run in electron
* `npm run package` to build distributable.

## Running on a server

We have included a message seeding utility (named "peerbot") that you can run yourself on a server to ensure that there will always be a peer available to connect to for a channel.

- first, follow the build instructions above
- `npm i electron-spawn electron-prebuilt -g`
- `electron-spawn peerbot.js --channel=cats`

it always seeds the `#friends` channel, pass `--channel=mychannel` to also seed another channel. you can specify as many channels as you want with multiple `--channel` flags

If you running it on headless Ubuntu, you will need to use `xvfb-run` to create a virtual display so that Chromium can run:

```
$ sudo apt-get install xvfb
$ xvfb-run electron-spawn peerbot.js
```

Also you [may need to `apt-get install libgconf-2-4`](https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/1518)
